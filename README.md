This is a console programme realising pseudorandom number generator using a Linear Feedback Shift Register.
We can enter any binary string of size n and we will receive all possible states of the LFSR with an initial state of that string.
It works by taking the last bit of each state and saving it, eventually producing a string of random numbers of size 2^n-1.
Each state is generated by executing an xor gate on the 2 last bits and adding the result to the begining of the string and shifting the other bits to the right.

Example:
Initial state of : 1101
Saved bit : 1 (last bit)
XOR gate : 0 XOR 1 = 1
Shift : 110
Add the result of XOR a on the begining.
Next state of our LFSR : 1110
